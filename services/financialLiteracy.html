                        There is widespread agreement that levels of financial literacy worldwide are low, 
                        especially in rural communities of Sub Saharan Africa, and that consumers tend to 
                        overestimate their financial skills and knowledge. The lack of basic financial 
                        literacy skills such as budgeting, saving, banking and managing money has weighed 
                        heavily on families in local communities during these unprecedented times. And, 
                        without a significant amount of money saved up, underserved communities have 
                        suffered due to layoffs, job loss and COVID-19-related illness and death in the 
                        household. Leaving households without any income for weeks.
